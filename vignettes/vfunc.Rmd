# The `vfunc` package

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(rmarkdown.html_vignette.check_title = FALSE)
library("vfunc")
set.seed(1)
```

```{r out.width='20%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("help/figures/vfunc.png", package = "vfunc"))
```

To cite the `vfunc` package in publications please use [@rcore2024].
In mathematics, given two functions
$f,g\colon\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, it is natural to
define $f+g$ as the function that maps $x\in\mathbb{R}$ to
$f(x)+g(x)$.  However, in base R [@rcore2024] this does not work:

```{r}
f <- function(x){x^2}
g <- function(x){1/(1-x)}
# f+g
```

The `vfunc` package furnishes some ways to accomplish this.

```{r}
f <- as.vf(f)
g <- as.vf(g)
f+g
```

Above, we coerce `f` and `g` to objects of `S4` class `vf` [for
"virtual function"].  Such objects have `Arith` methods defined and
may be combined arithmetically; for example addition is dispatched to

```
function(e1, e2){as.vf(function(...){e1(...) + e2(...)})}
```

The `vf` class has a single `.Data` slot of type `"function"` which
means that objects of this class inherit much of the behaviour of base
class `function`; above, we see that `e1` and `e2` may be executed
with their argument list directly.  In practice this means that `f+g`
behaves as intended:

```{r}
(f+g)(1:10)
```

The advantages of such idiom fall in to two main categories.  Firstly,
code can become considerably more compact; and secondly one can guard
against a wide class of hard-to-find bugs.  Now consider `f()` and
`g()` to be trivariate functions, each taking three arguments, say,


```{r}
f <- function(x,y,z){x + x*y - x/z}
g <- function(x,y,z){x^2 - z}
```

and $x=1.2$, $y=1.7$, $z=4.3$.  Given this, we wish to calculate

$$(f(x,y,z) + g(x,y,z))(f(x,y,z) + 4 - 2f(x,y,z)g(x,y,z)).$$

How would one code up such an expression in R?  The standard way would be

```{r}	  
 x <- 1.2
 y <- 1.7
 z <- 4.3		
(f(x,y,z) + g(x,y,z))*(f(x,y,z) + 4 - 2*f(x,y,z)*g(x,y,z))
```

Note the repeated specification of argument list `(x,y,z)`, repeated
here five times.  Now use the `vfunc` package:


```{r}
f <- as.vf(f)
g <- as.vf(g)
((f + g)*(f + 4 - 2*f*g))(x,y,z)
```

See how the package allows one to "factorize'' the argument list so
it appears once, leading to more compact code.  It is also arguably
less error-prone, as the following example illustrates.  Consider


$$
f(x+z,y+z,f(x,x,y)-g(x,x,y)) + g(x+z, y+z,f(x,x,y)-g(x,x,y))
$$


(such expressions arise in the study of dynamical systems).  Note that
functions $f$ and $g$ are to be evaluated with two distinct sets of
arguments at different levels of nesting, namely $(x,x,y)$ at the
inner level and $(x+z,y+z,f(x,x,y)-g(x,x,y)$ at the outer.  Standard R
idiom would be


```{r}
f(x+z, y+z, f(x, x, y) - g(x, x, y)) + g(x+z, y+z, f(x, x, y) - g(x, x, y))
```

The author can attest that finding bugs in such expressions can be
difficult [it is easy to mistype `(x,x,y)` in one of its apparitions,
and very hard to spot it].  However, `vfunc` idiom would be

```{r}
(f+g)(x+z, y+z, (f-g)(x, x, y))
```

which is certainly shorter, arguably neater and at least the author
finds such constructions considerably less error-prone.

## Note on primitive functions

The R language includes a number of primitive functions as `S4` Math
generics, including the trig functions such as `sin()`, and a few
others such as the cumulative sum `cumsum()`.  These functions are
quite deep-seated and cannot easily be modified to work with objects
of class `vf`.  The package uses capitalization.  Using `sin()` as an
example we have

```{r}
Sin
```

This construction allows one to use things like

```{r}
j <- Cos + Exp + 3
k <- Sin + Sin(Cos(Exp)) * Tan(Log)
(j + k/j)(pi/5)
```
