Description: If f <- function(x){x^2} and g <- function(x){x+1} it is
     a constant source of annoyance that "f+g" is not defined.
     Package 'vfunc' allows you to do this, and we have (f+g)(2)
     returning 6.  The other arithmetic operators are similarly
     implemented.  A wide class of coding bugs is eliminated.
